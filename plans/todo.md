# TODO List for Polymarket Trading Bot

This list outlines remaining tasks to get the bot operational and robust.

## Outstanding Development Tasks

### Core Bot Functionality
- [ ] **Integrate `market_finder.py`:** Ensure `signal_generator.py` dynamically fetches the correct active 15-minute BTC market `token_id` before generating signals.
- [ ] **Complete `risk_manager.py`:** Implement position sizing (based on confidence tiers), drawdown tracking, loss streak management, and other hard constraints.
- [ ] **Implement `polymarket_client.py` trading functions:** Add methods to place and cancel orders using `py-clob-client`, integrating with risk management.
- [ ] **Enhance `paper_trader.py`:** Add comprehensive logging and analysis to accurately validate win rate (>55%) and performance metrics.
- [ ] **Implement backtesting:** Use historical data (`btc_prices.csv`) to validate strategy and parameters before live trading.

### Data & Strategy
- [ ] **Smart Money Tracking:** Research and implement methods (API or scraping) to get top holder data from Polymarket.
- [ ] **Sentiment Analysis:** Explore feasibility and implementation of X/Twitter sentiment analysis if deemed valuable.
- [ ] **Refine Signal Logic:** Continuously review and adjust indicator thresholds and convergence rules based on paper trading and backtesting.

### Operational & Security
- [ ] **Robust API Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling and retry logic for Polymarket API interactions.
- [ ] **Telegram Notifications:** Ensure all critical events (trades, alerts, summaries) are sent reliably.
- [ ] **Security Audit:** Review all credential management and API interaction for security best practices.
- [ ] **Configuration Management:** Set up clear configuration for API keys, model endpoints, and strategy parameters.

## Model Preference for Trade Decisions

**Requirement:** For any task directly involving trade decisions, strategy refinement, or signal confirmation that requires higher-level reasoning, prioritize the following models via OpenRouter:

1.  **Primary:** `opus` (OpenRouter alias for `openrouter/anthropic/claude-opus-4.5`)
2.  **Secondary:** `kimi` (If Kimi 2.5 API is available and configured)

**Note:** This preference should be applied when spawning sub-agents or when specific decision-making logic needs external LLM calls that go beyond basic signal calculation. Basic indicator calculation and signal aggregation can remain within the core Python logic.
